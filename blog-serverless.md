# The state of the cloud: serverless


It looks like the world is changing faster than ever before, disrupting start-ups come from nowhere and challenge big companies to adapt. Technology provides connectivity as never before and the possibilities seem endless. This year the world got challenged like never before and we are using technology overcome issues in our daily life that would not have been possible 10 or even 5 years ago. In the past decade I have talked to a lot of development teams, CTOs and decision makers about the cloud, mainly Azure. From just grasping the concepts to help architecting specific solutions. If I look back, the thing that defining was the term 'As A Service'. 

## As a service

Al the discussions were about scale and cost control and reduction, for start-ups it was about not having to make investments upfront. In the end it is about not owning a big part of the stack. Not owning something also meant having different level of control, to choose your comfort zone we always had a good analogy, Pizza as a Service. Still today IaaS, PaaS and SaaS exist side by side for a reason. With IaaS you still get the maximum control over your environments, with PaaS you get to focus on your own code and with SaaS you are not more than a consumer. Within those groups there has been a lot of evolution though. The most difficult one to place for me to place are Containers, I would arguably place them as the pinnacle of IaaS because of the amount of control you have. Platform as a Service was always about not caring about anything but your own code with providing out of the box scale and cost control options. The ultimate version of this is SERVERLESS. 

## Serverless
Yes, we can discuss the name but most serverless offerings will scale back to zero hosts and cost nothing for those seconds. In the realm of serverless we can find a lot of different services, from storage and database solutions to compute or FaaS.
